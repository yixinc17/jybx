You can configure the site as follows:

2. **menu**, **footer**

    See the yaml files inside the `data/` directory.

## Start publishing

Follow the `exampleSite/`; specifically, the [content](https://github.com/onweru/newsroom/tree/master/exampleSite/content/post) directory

### Dark Mode

Today, operating systems have a system-wide __light ~ dark mode__ switch. Your website will adapt to the user's preferred lighting mode. Still, if the user wants to opt in or out of darkmode, there's a UI control for that too in the menu ðŸ˜Š.

#### Set a default lighting mode

Using your site's config.toml file, set the value of `defaultMode` to either `"dark"` or `"light"`.

If your site is built from a copy of the exampleSite, the field is already included; you only need to uncomment and set its value.

> The UI control for toggling darkmode will remain in place. This way, the user can decide which mode they would like to use while browsing your website
